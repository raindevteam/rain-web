      <h2>WHAT IS RAIN?</h2>
      <p>
      Rain(Bot) was essentially just another IRC bot. However, the goal now is to give a user an API, 
      or rather a framework, that they can leverage to quickly develop IRC bots, simple or complex. 
      </p>

      <h2>WHAT ISN'T RAIN?</h2>
      <p>
      Stable, that's for sure. Also, not a goto irc bot for simple users. At least not yet, we have
      been trying to keep the bot simple to use and as a matter of fact, a small one command bot can
      probably be feasible under 50 lines of code. But the library is still not user friendly, and
      debugging anything in RPC/Module territory requires some understanding of the bot's internals.
      For now test users are very much welcomed, and once we hit the 1.0.0 release mark, we'll hope to
      have plenty for the casual users.
